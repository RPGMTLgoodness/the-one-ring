**Backstory**
A veteran dwarf of the Iron Hills, Burin earned his name after his beard turned white in his youth when facing a troll deep in the mines. He spent decades fighting orcs across the North before an old wound slowed him down. Now older and weathered, he continues to wander, unwilling to lay down his sword.  

**Character Traits**  
Grim, proud, and direct. Burin speaks his mind and has little patience for foolishness. He’s quick to challenge others but commands respect through his bearing and experience.

**Motivation**  
Though he claims to seek battle with the Enemy, there are no orcs in Bree — only rumours and uneasy tidings. It is unclear whether he hunts true evil or simply the echo of a purpose he cannot abandon.  

**Character Relationships**
Badbartigan has been his periodic traveling companion and once-pupil, whom he treats as both student and burden.
