***Journey into the Weather Hills***

Early spring of the year TA 2961
Traveling from the village of Bree northwards into the Weather Hills
Duration - one week

**Departing the Village of Bree**
The companions gathered over breakfast at the Prancing Pony to weigh their next steps. Burin voiced his distrust of Jari, while Periwinkle argued that one dwarf’s warning was not enough to cast aside their opportunity. A brief debate arose over whether to provide ponies for Periwinkle and Galraith, but Burin refused the idea. In the end, the group chose to continue the venture.

Jari arrived promptly, cheerful and ready to depart, with Diarmoc and their pack mule waiting outside. The company set out from Bree, travelling through the rising hills and scattered farmland until the fields gave way to woodland. Near the edge of Bree-land they encountered an elderly Hedge-Warden named Ed, who warned them about dangers in the north but grew evasive when asked about Rangers and Orothel. Through Periwinkle’s easy manner and Burin’s imposing presence, Ed relented and offered shelter for the night. Over supper, he admitted that many Rangers passed through the region and that Orothel herself had travelled north two weeks prior, speaking of troll activity in the Weather Hills.

**Wolves in the Chetwood**
The company pressed on through the Chetwood. On the second night, a pack of wolves ambushed their camp, but the attack was swiftly repelled—Badbartigan striking with theatrical flourish, Galraith with cold precision. Jari was visibly impressed by their prowess and eagerly praised them, promising greater rewards. The next day, Badbartigan confided his discomfort at how readily Jari increased their promised payment, suspecting ulterior motives. During the day’s march, Diarmoc finally spoke, remarking on their skill in battle. He shared little, but mentioned that wolves in the north had grown more aggressive, and that such fighters would be welcomed among his people.

**Signs of Ranger Activity**
Leaving the forest behind them on the fourth day, the group traversed the rocky, mist-laden lands leading toward the Weather Hills. On the fifth day, Badbartigan noted boot tracks veering off the trail at the same moment that Galraith discovered Dúnedain markings indicating a nearby hideout. They followed the signs and rested within the hidden refuge. While dining by the fire, Burin questioned Jari more directly about what dangers they might face and what exactly composed the treasure hoard they were seeking. Jari’s reactions revealed a lack of clarity and visible discomfort. During the conversation, Galraith caught Diarmoc watching Jari with unmistakable hatred before quickly masking it. Later, Galraith approached him privately; Diarmoc offered only evasive explanations, though he admitted that distrusting Jari was wise.

**Trolls in the Weather Hills**
The remainder of the journey passed quietly until they reached the narrow valley leading into the upper hills. The final ascent was slow, and along the trail Galraith discovered a Dunedain rune warning clearly of trolls ahead. Jari attempted to dismiss the danger and urged them onward, but the party chose to search the trail carefully. Perry and Badbartigan found troll footprints not far up the path, confirming their fears.

As dusk approached, the group debated their next move: Badbartigan, Galraith, and Periwinkle preferred returning to safer ground for the night, while Burin pressed to advance regardless of the growing dark. Jari attempted to calm their concerns, but when pressed about troll presence, he struggled to offer convincing answers. Diarmoc seemed quietly amused by Jari’s rising distress. Ultimately, the party chose caution and descended to camp further from the suspected troll haunt, setting a watch but intentionally excluding Jari from participating.

Despite these precautions, they awoke in the morning to find both Jari and Diarmoc gone—vanished during Diarmoc’s watch. Their footprints led unmistakably back up the trail, toward the valley above and into the waiting shadows of the hills.
