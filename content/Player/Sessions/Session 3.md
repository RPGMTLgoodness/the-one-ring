***The Trolls of Morglynd Valley***

Early spring of the year TA 2961
The Vale of Morglynd deep in the Weather Hills
Two days

**Ascent into the Valley**
The fellowship awoke to find Jari and Diarmoc gone without a word, their bedrolls abandoned and their tracks already fading into the stone and dust of the valley trail. As Periwinkle checked their camp, he discovered a crude hand-drawn map tucked unexpectedly into his bedding. Though clumsy, it clearly showed landmarks of the valley ahead and three ominous markings made in the Dúnedain rune for troll-sign—one upon the trail ahead, another upon a western hill, and one in the lake itself.  

With growing unease and lingering distrust of Jari’s story, the fellowship began to piece together what might truly be happening. Thoughts varied—perhaps Diarmoc had been manipulated, perhaps they themselves had been meant as sacrifice, or perhaps something far darker was unfolding. Regardless, Burin Whitebeard, Galraith Holborn, Badbartigan, and Periwinkle Dandelion pressed onward, ascending the narrow river path into the Vale of Morglynd. They stayed carefully in sunlight wherever possible, aware that trolls might lurk in the shade. Above them, mountains closed in; ahead, the valley opened like a dark wound in the land.

**The Abandoned Farmhouse**
Their first destination was a lonely farmhouse now swallowed by desolation. The once-worked land was now nothing but weed-choked growth, scattered bones, and the carcasses of livestock left to rot. The building itself remained structurally sound, yet visibly assaulted: doors shattered, belongings smashed, everything violated and abandoned.

Inside, Galraith identified small footprints in the dust. Calling softly into the silence brought trembling movement beneath the kitchen trapdoor. There the fellowship found Scylda, an eight-year-old girl who had survived alone for over a month, hiding while trolls prowled the valley. Terrified but courageous, she shared key truths. She had seen three trolls—two smaller brutes that roamed constantly and entered the ruined tower, and a third that haunted the lake and terrified her so deeply that she avoided the water entirely. She had also witnessed another dwarf once arrive with a group of people… none of whom ever came back from the hilltop ruin.

Despite fear and trauma, Scylda trusted the group. And for the first time in weeks, hope returned to her eyes.

**The Lake Rescue**
With daylight still remaining, the fellowship chose to investigate the lake first. There, upon the water, they spotted a raft drifting slowly with three barely conscious figures—an adult and two children. With Galraith’s spyglass, they confirmed the truth; the figures seemed too terrified to jump, repeatedly warning them off from the water.  

Guided by Scylda, the company found a hidden boat. Galraith and Burin rowed out while Badbartigan and Periwinkle covered the shoreline with bows drawn. They reached the raft and discovered a Lossoth woman and her two children, gaunt, exhausted, but alive. Then the lake struck back. Something beneath the surface seized Burin’s paddle in a sudden violent pull. Only through sheer strength did he hold fast. Galraith, weapon ready, scanned the depths. When the spectral hand reached again, Galraith drove his spear downward, striking true and drawing blood. The threat retreated, and the group made it safely ashore.  

There, the woman revealed her identity: she was Diarmoc’s wife. Her family had come south seeking safety. Jari had promised haven. Instead, they had been given to trolls. She had not seen Diarmoc since.  

**Battle with Nelly Longarms**
The fellowship returned Scylda and the rescued family to the farmhouse, then prepared to confront the lake-troll at sundown. They laid a trip-line, built a strong fire as a focal point, and took strategic positions—Periwinkle and Galraith concealed above, bows ready; Burin and Bad Bardagain waiting to meet the charge.

Darkness gathered. A great shadow crept from the water’s edge, circling, slipping in and out of the gloom. Arrows flew; the mist rolled in around her. And then the truth of the threat emerged: Nelly Longarms, matriarch troll of Morglynd Vale. 

The battle was savage and desperate. Badbartigan struck first, carving deep into her monstrous chest. Burin struck as well—but the response was brutal, his shield shattered and his arm nearly ruined beneath the troll’s strength. Periwinkle, in the thick of terror, attempted to rally his companions—once finding courage successfully, the second time feeling the fear of death and failure claw at his spirit, courage shaken by the enormity of what they faced. 

Then Nelly seized Badbartigan, crushing him in her grasp, disarming him, threatening to snap him like dry tinder. And in that moment, Galraith ended it. His arrow struck through Nelly’s throat.

Troll blood filled the air, covering Galraith as the troll's grasp loosened. He followed with a final charge, his spear piercing her heart. The matriarch fell. The terror of the vale was dead.

The fellowship returned to the farmhouse exhausted, covered in blood and dirt, collapsing into uneasy but victorious sleep.

**The Tower**
With renewed resolve, the fellowship turned next toward the ruined tower. Scylda revealed an old maintenance shaft beneath it—too narrow for trolls, and perhaps forgotten. With Periwinkle’s rope, they descended into darkness. 

Burin emerged first, spotting one troll asleep and another standing guard up the stairs near the only exit to sunlight. The company attempted a stealth ambush, but fate intervened—the first troll awoke with a grunt as an arrow struck, and the chamber erupted into violence.  

What followed was decisive, brutal efficiency. Galraith and Burin struck with devastating force. 
The first troll never had a chance to escape. The second turned to run, only to find itself trapped, terrified, and slaughtered soon after—though not before landing a heavy blow against Galraith.

The tower was theirs. And there, among the plunder and filth, lay Jari’s belongings. So the fellowship waited.  

**Conclusion**
Not long after, Jari descended into the tower. Shock washed across his face, followed by a brief flicker of relief —and then dread as understanding dawned on him. Diarmoc followed behind. In a heartbeat, he took in the scene, strode forward, and struck Jari unconscious with his staff before collapsing into tears. 

When Jari awoke, the truth finally spilled free. Jari had made a cowardly bargain with the horrific trolls, and their now dead matriarch. He would bring them fresh victims and in exchange acquire whatever gold or treasures the victims might be carrying. Diarmoc was roped into the scheme out of desperation to keep his family alive, ever hopeful for eventual revenge against the dwarf.  

The group returned toward the farmhouse, the vale now free of troll rule. There, sitting calmly at the threshold, waited an older woman—weathered cloak, ranger’s bearing, watchful patience. Galbraith recognized her as the ranger Orothel, who he had not seen for many decades.

She thanked them for accomplishing what she had come to face. Then she turned to Galraith Holborn, naming him the “heir of Tarandis”.
