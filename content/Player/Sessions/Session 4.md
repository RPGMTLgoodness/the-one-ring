***The Trial of Jari the Dwarf, a Secret, and Rumours of the Grey Pilgrim***

Early spring of the year TA 2961
Vale of Morglynd deep in the Weather Hills and along the Great East Road 
Two weeks

**Arrival at the Farmhouse and the Trial of Jari**
The company returned to the farmhouse as triumphant heroes, but also as survivors burdened by difficult decisions. Troll blood still stained armour and cloak, and dragged behind them was the unconscious dwarf Jari, whose treachery had nearly destroyed Diarmoc’s family and doomed the company itself.  

Inside the farmhouse, the group encountered Orothel, a seasoned ranger known distantly to Galraith. She thanked them for eliminating the troll threat, but her attention quickly turned to their prisoner.

The matter of Jari’s fate erupted into fierce disagreement. Galraith argued swiftly and without hesitation that Jari deserved death. The crimes were too grave, and the danger of allowing him to live too great. He openly declared his willingness to execute Jari himself if necessary. Badbartigan supported a similarly harsh resolution, initially insisting that Diarmoc, as the wronged party, should carry out the execution personally. Opposing them stood Burin, Badbartigan’s mentor and fellow dwarf to Jari. Burin insisted that Jari must face judgment through proper process. Justice, he argued, required more than vengeance — even if the outcome seemed obvious. Perry supported the older dwarf’s views.  

Diarmoc himself spoke with surprising restraint. He believed Jari deserved death, but refused to carry out the execution personally. In his homeland, he explained, criminals were sometimes abandoned to die rather than executed directly — allowing fate to deliver judgment without placing blood directly upon one’s hands.  

Importantly, Diarmoc expressed deep shame and regret toward the company for his earlier involvement in their plight. He declared a life debt to them and insisted upon the dishonourable nature of his actions. The party themselves expressed no anger towards Diarmoc.  

Ultimately, Orothel agreed to arbitrate the matter and questioned carefully all of the involved parties. Jari attempted multiple contradictory defenses — claiming misunderstanding, treasure hunting, and ignorance — but none survived scrutiny. His inability to explain his close cooperation with the trolls sealed his fate. 

Though no formal sentence was announced, the company agreed upon a compromise. Jari would be returned to dwarven authorities to face judgment among his own people. Orothel promised that incoming Rangers would escort him. Diarmoc volunteered to join that escort, ensuring the prisoner would not escape.  

**A Private Conversation with Orothel**
During their stay, Orothel requested a private audience with Galraith. She revealed troubling rumours emerging from the south. In the town of Lond Daer, a mysterious woman had declared herself queen. Stranger still, this queen had begun searching for the Heir of Tarandis, an ancient lineage of the Dúnedain — a lineage Orothel recalled Galraith belongs to. Galraith himself recalls little of the name, beyond knowing he was said to have died in the long battle against the Witch King of Angmar in generations past.  

Her knowledge was incomplete. The queen’s origins were unclear, her authority unofficial, and her rise surrounded by unusual tales — including claims that she had slain a sea serpent to earn loyalty from local fishermen and villagers. Orothel offered Galraith no guidance beyond warning him of the rumour’s existence.  

Later, Galraith informed the company only that he possessed personal business drawing him south toward Laundale. He did not reveal the details shared with him by Orothel, but invited his companions to join him if they so chose.  

**Brief Downtime in the Valley**
The company remained in the valley for several days while awaiting Ranger reinforcements.

During this time:
- Perry quietly prepared a formal sworn affidavit documenting Jari’s crimes, reflecting his commitment to order and civic structure.
- Badbartigan privately wrestled with his understanding of justice. Though he had argued for execution earlier, he began questioning whether civilized trials merely disguised harsher realities of survival and retribution in the wild.
- The party composed an epic battle song called The Slaying of Nelly Longarms.  

Scylda, the orphan, began forming tentative bonds with Diarmoc’s family and the Rangers stationed in the valley. Surprisingly resilient despite her trauma, she begins forming friendships with Diarmoc's children

**Rumours of Gandalf the Grey**
Before the company departed, Orothel brought forth another rumour. Travellers from Bree had reportedly joined a gathering of young men travelling east along the Great East Road. These recruits believed they were answering a call from Gandalf the Grey, who allegedly sought labourers for some mission of unknown purpose. 

The report unsettled Orothel. Gandalf was known to the Rangers, yet this behaviour seemed unusual. He rarely gathered such followers, and never without explanation. 

The rumour sparked immediate interest within the company — especially from Badbartigan, whose admiration for the wizard bordered on hero worship. Galraith remained notably reserved.

The possibility arose that the rumour might not involve Gandalf at all, but someone impersonating him.

**Journey Along the Great East Road**
With Ranger reinforcements arriving to assume custody of Jari, the company departed the valley. Though the prisoner remained alive, his fate was now firmly in the hands of dwarven justice, with Diarmoc joining the escort northward. The company, meanwhile, turned their attention eastward, their destination uncertain but their purpose shared.

Burin took responsibility for guiding the company along the safest routes through the Weather Hills, while Perry ranged ahead as scout. Badbartigan hunted for provisions, and Galraith maintained constant watch for danger and signs of civilization.

The early days of travel passed with relative success. The company weathered poor conditions and fatigue, but Burin’s steady guidance kept them on course toward the Great East Road. Though the land bore the scars of ancient kingdoms, the wilderness remained vast and largely empty — a reminder of how much of Eriador had fallen into ruin since the fall of its former realms.

Galraith, reflecting on these desolate landscapes, shared what knowledge he possessed of the region’s history. The hills and barrows scattered throughout the area were remnants of forgotten fortresses, noble keeps, and burial sites of ancient lords. Such ruins were known to hide relics of lost wars and buried artifacts of great power. If Gandalf truly sought to unearth something in this region, Galraith suggested, it was unlikely to be simple treasure. More likely, it would be something dangerous enough to warrant protection from darker forces.

The journey remained uneventful until the sixth day. While hunting away from camp, Badbartigan encountered two young villagers attempting — with remarkable incompetence — to ambush deer using poorly maintained bows and even poorer technique. Rather than reveal himself quietly, Badbartigan chose a more theatrical approach, firing an arrow deliberately into a tree beside them and confronting them with warrior’s authority.

Terrified and thoroughly shaken, the young hunters revealed that they were travelling east, hoping to join a gathering rumoured to be organized by Gandalf himself. They spoke of promises of glory, treasure, and an excavation requiring strong labourers. Their information proved vague and second-hand, passed through relatives and rumours rather than direct knowledge. Badbartigan dismissed them after the interrogation, leaving the pair in heated argument about whether their journey was worth continuing at all. He returned to camp with fresh venison, new intelligence, and lingering suspicion that the excavation could be something far more sinister than it appeared.

The company pressed onward. Over the following days, the terrain gradually softened. The deep wilderness gave way to signs of fragile resettlement — scattered stone walls, abandoned road markers, and occasional smoke rising faintly on the horizon. By the tenth day, the company reached the outskirts of small rural holdings clustered near the road and river crossings. These were not villages in any true sense, but fragile enclaves of families who had carved existence from the wilds, living in wary independence.

**The Homestead and Jenny Greenteeth**
Near the road and signs of scattered homesteads, the company encountered an elderly local woman living among isolated farmsteads. Seeking information, rest, and food, Badbartigan used his charm and eagerness to  engage her in conversation. While initially reluctant, she was disarmed by Badbartigan’s surprising interest in her (a sentiment equally shared by the rest of the party).

She complained openly about the gang of overenthusiastic youths who had overrun the area. They have gathered in the hills north of the hamlet, known for its sprawling and decaying ruins. The woman had never heard of Gandalf of the Grey. Instead, she spoke of a reclusive scholar known locally as Old Thornley, a wandering figure occasionally dressed in grey robes. Whether Thornley was Gandalf, an imposter, or an entirely unrelated figure remained uncertain. She spoke also of members of this group having now barred the Last Bridge demanding tolls from passing travelers - allegedly to support the excavation mission.

While the rest of the party toiled outside the house repairing the old woman’s fence, under the expert guidance and notable ambition of Burin, Badbartigan offered the old lonely woman a much unexpected moment of intimate distraction, followed by a hearty meal of rabbit stew and the haze of pipe weed. Upon his departure in the morning, Badbartigan was taken aback at the surprising number of notches on the bedpost of this elderly woman (many of which rather recent).

**Closing Position**
By the end of their travels, the party faces the following leads:
- The involvement of a reclusive local man known as Old Thornley 
- The still unresolved mystery behind the true purpose of Gandalf the Grey
- The location of the excavation site in the northern hills, allegedly difficult to access with ruffians keeping watch at the campsite
- The presence of armed men having taken control of the The Last Bridge and demanding tolls from all passer-bys to support the excavation  

The party must decide which lead to follow as they leave the hamlet in the early morning.
