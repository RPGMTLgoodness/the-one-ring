***A Chance Meeting at the Prancing Pony***

Early spring of the year TA 2961
The Village of Bree

**Introducing Burin Whitebeard and Badbartigan**
Burin Whitebeard, a battle-scarred Dwarf of the Blue Mountains, traveled west with Badbartigan, a confident Barding warrior known for his twin blades and reckless courage. The two had shared many months of the road, their friendship forged in mutual respect and constant disagreement. Burin carried the weight of age and past wounds; Bad carried youth, swagger, and the need to prove himself.  

They had joined a merchant caravan bound for Bree, hoping to test themselves against orcs rumored to haunt the passes. Yet the journey proved uneventful. The orcs never came, and the only sign of them was a dying wretch by the roadside whom Burin dispatched without ceremony. The merchants paid them well, but there was no glory in the crossing.  

In Bree, they took their pay in lodging and ale at the Prancing Pony. Burin sat apart, listening to talk among the locals. Two farmers at a nearby table spoke of a wandering wizard who had passed through Staddle with a rough band of men. They claimed he had called himself Gandalf, though the details of their story shifted with each cup. Burin leaned in to question them further. They swore he had been grey and tall but could provide little else that was certain. Burin listened in silence, unconvinced but thoughtful.  

Meanwhile, Badbartigan noticed an ancient woman sitting alone by the bar and approached her. Her eyes were milky and distant, her voice thin and cracked.

“There’s a wind that comes from the north,” she told him. “Cold and metallic. It sets the dogs to howling.”

When he jested that perhaps it carried gold, she replied simply, “Steel.” Then she turned away and began muttering softly to herself. Butterbur, the innkeeper, apologized for her behavior and explained that she was harmless, “just talks with wind.”  

**The Performance of Periwinkle Dandelion** 
Across the room, Periwinkle Dandelion — a local man of Bree with bright eyes and greater ambition — was performing for a modest crowd. His songs were cheerful, full of dreams of lost fortunes and grand adventures. Badbartigan, intrigued by the attention the performer drew, attempted to ingratiate himself, hoping to share in the charm that surrounded the young man. His efforts were less graceful than intended, but the two spoke amiably enough, and Bad’s bravado found an audience among the tavern’s groupies lingering near the music.

**The Arrival of Galraith Holborn**
Later that evening, Galraith Holborn arrived in Bree. A Dúnedain messenger and wanderer lost to his own personal tragedies, he had come north after hearing that the Ranger Orothel was searching for him. Upon arrival, he learned she had already passed through Bree weeks before and then “gone wandering,” leaving no clear direction behind her.

Inside the Pony, Galraith reunited briefly with Periwinkle, exchanging familiar words before turning to the innkeeper for news. Butterbur confirmed Orothel’s earlier visit and recalled that she had left a message to keep watch for a specific Dúnedain messenger - Galraith himself. None had seen her since.

In the same conversation, Galraith heard of other Rangers sighted in the wilds north of Bree — keeping to the shadows, as Rangers do — and a merchant passing through spoke of Captain Gurnow, the stern new authority in Tharbad who had finally restored order to the city by force of will and iron rule.

**Jari’s Proposal**  
As the night thinned and the fire in the hearth burned low, a stocky, well-dressed Dwarf entered the common room. He introduced himself as Jari, a traveler from the Blue Mountains, and sought strong companions for a venture east of Bree. His tale was simple: his uncle had hidden a great treasure in a secluded valley and died before reclaiming it. Jari had found the place but needed help recovering what was rightfully his.

He gestured to a quiet northern man sitting alone — one of the Lossoth — and named him as his scout. The promise of fair pay and a short journey drew the attention of Burin, Bad, Periwinkle, and Galraith, who agreed to the seemingly simple quest.

**Floki’s Warning**
After Jari and the Lossoth left the inn, two younger Dwarves who had been sitting quietly in the corner beckoned Burin over for a discussion. One introduced himself as Floki, the other as Hornbori.

Floki regarded them gravely. “You’d be wise to think twice about Jari,” he said. “We’ve known him before. His ventures rarely end well. He’s not trusted among our kind. There were dealings that shamed his kin — he was exiled from the Blue Mountains.”

Burin pressed for more. Floki hesitated, then added, “He’s no adventurer. He’s a scavenger of tombs, a dealer in Dwarven relics and grave goods. My own brother followed him once. It did not end well.”

Floki leaned back, pipe glowing in the lamplight. “If he tells you he’s found lost gold, remember that some things are buried for good reason.”

**Session End**
The four companions retired to their rooms, agreeing to meet Jari at first light. As they settled in for the night, Badbartigan slept restlessly as the wind outside his window rose again — cold and metallic — with the baying of dogs in the distance.
