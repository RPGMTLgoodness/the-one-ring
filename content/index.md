# Eriador in the Third Age (2961 T.A.)

Nearly twenty years have passed since the wyrm Smaug was slain and the Necromancer driven from Dol Guldur. Those victories brought hope to distant realms, but in Eriador their effects are subtle. The North is quieter than it was, yet not truly at peace—emptier, rather than healed. Ancient kingdoms lie in ruin, their roads broken and watchtowers abandoned. Bree remains a rare crossroads of peoples; Rivendell endures as a place of memory and counsel; the Shire lies sheltered and complacent, scarcely aware of the wider world. The Dúnedain still guard these lands, but they do so unseen, protecting folk who no longer know their name.

This is an age between turning points. Orcs and trolls are fewer, but not gone, and the wilderness presses close to the last settled roads. Nearly thirty years remain before Balin will attempt to reclaim Moria, and more than forty before Frodo Baggins inherits a small ring that will change the fate of the world. For now, Eriador waits—weathered, watchful, and quietly balanced between fading legend and coming storm.
